# Background üìñ
This is my first SQL project, undertaken as part of my journey to delve into the world of machine learning (ML). As someone who is keenly interested in pursuing a career in ML, I chose this project to not only learn SQL but also to investigate the skills and trends that are crucial for a successful ML career. By analyzing job postings and salaries, I aimed to gain insights into the most valuable skills and job market dynamics for ML roles.

Throughout this project, I focused on answering the following key questions:

1. **What are the top paying ML roles and the companies offering them?** 
2. **What are the top 10 skills required for the highest paying ML jobs?**
3. **What are the most in-demand skills for onsite versus remote ML jobs?**
4. **What is the average salary by skill for ML jobs?**
5. **Which companies pay the most on average to for ML role, including those offering health insurance?**
6. **What are the busiest times of the year for ML job postings?**
7. **What are the most optimal skills for ML roles based on high demand and high salary?**
# Tools I Used üî®
In order to complete this project I used the following tools:
1. SQL
2. PostgreSQL
3. VS Code and Juptyer Notebook
4. Pandas, Seaborn and Matplotlib
4. Git & Github
# The Analysis üìà
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the ML job market. Here is how I went about answering each question. 
### Question 1: Investigating the highest paying roles üí∞
For this query, I aimed to identify the **top 10 highest-paying machine learning (ML) roles** and the **companies offering them**. Key steps included:

- **Filtering**: Selected job postings related to ML roles by using the `ILIKE` command to perform a case-insensitive search for job titles containing "Machine Learning" or "ML." Additionally, I excluded postings with NULL salaries.
- **Joining**: Combined job postings using `LEFT JOIN` with the company dimension table to include company details.
- **Sorting**: Ordered the results by average salary in descending order to highlight the top-paying roles.
- **Limiting**: Limited the results to the top 10 highest-paying roles.

Why‚ùì This approach highlights the most lucrative opportunities for ML engineers and provides insights into high-paying positions in the industry.
```SQL
SELECT 
    companies.name AS company_name, 
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type, 
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date 
FROM 
    job_postings_fact AS job_postings
LEFT JOIN company_dim AS companies ON job_postings.company_id = companies.company_id
WHERE 
    (job_title ILIKE '%Machine Learning%' 
    OR job_title ILIKE '% ML %')
    AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL 
ORDER BY 
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10; 
```
#### Key Takeaways: Investigating the Highest Paying ML Roles

1. **Senior Management Focus**: Most of the highest-paying ML roles are senior management positions, such as Applied Data Science Leaders and Senior Managers, indicating a demand for experienced professionals in these high-level roles.

2. **Significant Salary Differences**: There is a considerable range in salaries among the top 10 roles, with the highest paying $425,000 and others around $300,000, highlighting a substantial disparity in compensation within the top-paying positions.

3. **Geographical Distribution**: Many of the highest-paying roles are located in San Francisco, CA, but there are also significant opportunities in other locations like Toronto and San Mateo, as well as for remote positions, showcasing diverse geographic options for high-paying ML jobs.

### Question 2: What are the top 10 skills required for the highest paying ML jobs?
This query aims to identify the top 10 most frequently mentioned skills in the highest-paying machine learning (ML) job postings. To achieve this, I focused on analyzing the top 50 highest-paying ML job postings. Key steps included:

- **Subquery**: Used a subquery wherein I selected the top 50 ML job and then ordered the results by salary in descending order to capture the highest-paying jobs.
- **Joining**: Joined the selected top-paying jobs with the relevant skills data by matching job IDs with skill IDs using `INNER JOIN`.
- **Grouping and Counting**: Grouped the results by each skill and counted the number of job postings that mentioned each skill.

Why‚ùì This query helps identify the most valuable skills associated with the highest-paying ML jobs, providing insights for job seekers on which skills to prioritize.
```SQL
SELECT 
    skills.skills,
    COUNT(skills) AS skill_count 
FROM (
    SELECT 
        job_id
    FROM 
        job_postings_fact AS job_postings
    WHERE 
        (job_title ILIKE '%Machine Learning%' 
        OR job_title ILIKE '% ML %') 
        AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL 
    ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC 
    LIMIT 50 
) AS top_ML_jobs
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim AS skills_to_job ON top_ML_jobs.job_id = skills_to_job.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim AS skills ON skills_to_job.skill_id = skills.skill_id
WHERE skills.skills IS NOT NULL 
GROUP BY skills
ORDER BY skill_count DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```
#### Key Takeaways from Query 2:

### Question 3: What are the most in-demand skills for onsite versus remote ML jobs?
This query investigates the most in-demand skills across all machine learning (ML) jobs and compares whether the required skills differ for remote versus onsite positions. The goal is to provide insights into the most sought-after skills for ML roles, helping job seekers tailor their learning.
  
- **Onsite Jobs**: Created a CTE (`in_demand_skills_o`) to identify the top 10 most frequently mentioned skills in onsite ML jobs by filtering out remote jobs (`job_location <> 'Anywhere'`).

- **Remote Jobs**: Created a second CTE (`in_demand_skills_r`) to focus on the top 10 skills in remote ML jobs by selecting only those with `job_location = 'Anywhere'`.

- **Grouping and Counting**: For both CTEs, grouped the results by skill and counted the number of job postings mentioning each skill.

- **Comparison**: The query results allow for a comparison of in-demand skills between remote and onsite ML positions, offering strategic insights for career development.
```SQL
WITH in_demand_skills_o AS (
    SELECT 
        skills.skills,
        COUNT(job_postings.job_id) AS demand_count 
    FROM job_postings_fact AS job_postings
    LEFT JOIN skills_job_dim AS skills_to_job ON job_postings.job_id = skills_to_job.job_id
    LEFT JOIN skills_dim AS skills ON skills_to_job.skill_id = skills.skill_id
    WHERE 
        (job_title ILIKE '%Machine Learning%' 
        OR job_title ILIKE '% ML %') 
        AND job_location <> 'Anywhere' -- Exclude remote jobs
    GROUP BY skills.skills
    ORDER BY demand_count DESC
    LIMIT 10
)
SELECT * 
FROM in_demand_skills_o;

WITH in_demand_skills_r AS (
    SELECT 
        skills.skills,
        COUNT(job_postings.job_id) AS demand_count
    FROM job_postings_fact AS job_postings
    LEFT JOIN skills_job_dim AS skills_to_job ON job_postings.job_id = skills_to_job.job_id
    LEFT JOIN skills_dim AS skills ON skills_to_job.skill_id = skills.skill_id
    WHERE 
        (job_title ILIKE '%Machine Learning%' 
        OR job_title ILIKE '% ML %') 
        AND job_location = 'Anywhere' 
    GROUP BY skills.skills
    ORDER BY demand_count DESC
    LIMIT 10
)
SELECT *
FROM in_demand_skills_r;
```
#### Key Takeaways: Most In-Demand Skills for Onsite vs. Remote ML Jobs
1. **Dominance of Python**: Python is the most in-demand skill for both onsite and remote ML jobs, but its demand is significantly higher for onsite positions, reflecting its central role in ML across various job types.

### Question 4: What is the average salary by skill for ML jobs?
This query calculates the average salary for skills required in machine learning (ML) jobs, focusing on skills mentioned in at least 50 job postings to ensure reliable data.

- **Grouping and Counting**: Grouped by skill and calculated the rounded average salary for each. Used the `HAVING` clause to ensure only skills with at least 50 job postings were included.

The results help job seekers identify the most lucrative skills to prioritize in their ML careers.
```SQL
SELECT
    skills.skills,
    ROUND(AVG(salary_year_avg), 0) AS avg_salary,
    COUNT(job_postings.job_id) AS job_count
FROM job_postings_fact AS job_postings
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim AS skills_to_job ON job_postings.job_id = skills_to_job.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim AS skills ON skills_to_job.skill_id = skills.skill_id
WHERE
    (job_title ILIKE '%Machine Learning%' 
    OR job_title ILIKE '% ML %') 
    AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY skills.skills
HAVING COUNT(job_postings.job_id) >= 50 
ORDER BY avg_salary DESC
LIMIT 10
```
